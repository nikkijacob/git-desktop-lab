Git and GitHub with GitHub Desktop

This is branch B and A

This lab is to gain practical experience using Git and GitHub with GitHub Desktop for version control, collaboration, and conflict resolution. Students will learn to create and manage repositories, commit changes, work with branches, and resolve merge conflicts using a GUI-based workflow.

Documentation:

1. Repository Setup
What I did:
Created a repository named git-desktop-lab, initialized it with a README, and cloned it locally using GitHub Desktop.

Purpose:
To set up the foundational structure for version control and enable syncing between local and remote code.

Challenges:
No major issues, but ensuring GitHub Desktop was properly linked to my GitHub account was important.

2. Basic Git Operations
What I did:
Created an info.txt file with my personal details and updated the README.md with a lab description.
Committed and pushed both changes with clear commit messages.

Purpose:
To learn how to create and edit files in a repository, and understand how commits track changes over time.

Challenges:
Remembering to write clear, meaningful commit messages required extra attention.

3. Branching and Merging
What I did:
Created a new branch feature/new-content, added a content.txt file, committed and pushed the branch, and then merged it into main via a pull request.

Purpose:
To understand how branching allows isolated work on new features, and how pull requests are used to review and merge code safely.

Challenges:
Getting used to switching between branches and tracking which branch I was working in.

4. Merge Conflict Resolution
What I did:
Created branch-a and branch-b with conflicting edits in README.md, merged branch-a into main, then pulled into branch-b to create a conflict.
Used GitHub Desktop to resolve the conflict, committed the fix, and merged branch-b into main.

Purpose:
To practice handling merge conflicts, which are common in collaborative workflows. It showed how to identify, resolve, and finalize conflicting changes.

Challenges:
Resolving the conflict clearly and correctly took some patience, especially understanding how Git marks the conflicting sections.
