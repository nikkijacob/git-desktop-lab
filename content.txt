I’ve been hooked on Genshin Impact from the moment I first dove into Teyvat. There’s something about the mix of stunning landscapes, immersive lore, and the thrill of pulling a new character that keeps me coming back. Whether I’m gliding through Liyue or strategizing team comps, the game’s become my go-to escape—equal parts chill and chaotic. It’s not just a game; it’s a little world I love getting lost in.
